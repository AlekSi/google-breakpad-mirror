All sourcecode in this file is generated using the .proto and protoc from

To make changes edit the .proto file and regenerate the dependent files for
check in.

Troubleshooting for Protobuf:

Install:
If you are getting permission errors install, make sure you are not trying to
install from an NFS.


Running protoc:
protoc: error while loading shared libraries: libprotobuf.so.0: cannot open
shared object file: No such file or directory

The issue is that Ubuntu 8.04 doesn't include /usr/local/lib in
library paths. 

To fix it for your current terminal session, just type in
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
